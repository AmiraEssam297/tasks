The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes 
to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists,
stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. 
It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. 
Working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of algorithms, 
data structures, and other components that can be used to simplify the development of C++ programs. 
The STL provides a range of containers, such as vectors, lists, and maps, as well as algorithms for searching, 
sorting and manipulating data.

One of the key benefits of the STL is that it provides a way to write generic, 
reusable code that can be applied to different data types.is means that you can write an algorithm once,
 and then use it with different types of data without having to write separate code for each type.

The STL also provides a way to write efficient code.
 Many of the algorithms and data structures in the STL are implemented using optimized algorithms, 
which can result in faster execution times compared to custom code.

Some of the key components of the STL include:
Containers: The STL provides a range of containers, such as vector, list, map, set, and stack, which can be used to store and manipulate data.
Algorithms: The STL provides a range of algorithms, such as sort, find, and binary_search, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.
Iterators: Iterators are objects that provide a way to traverse the elements of a container. The STL provides a range of iterato
