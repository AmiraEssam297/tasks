what is clean code!?
Clean code is a term used to refer to code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.
It was made popular by Robert Cecil Martin, also known as Uncle Bob,
who wrote "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" in 2008.

Principles of Clean Code:
1. Avoid Hard-Coded Numbers
2. Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names
3. Use Comments Sparingly, and When You Do, Make Them Meaningful
4. Write Short Functions That Only Do One Thing
5. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle and Avoid Duplicating Code or Logic
6. Follow Established Code-Writing Standards
7. Encapsulate Nested Conditionals into Functions
8. Refactor Continuously
9. Use Version Control
